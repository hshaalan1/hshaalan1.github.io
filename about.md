My name is Haya Shaalan and I am a 4th year molecular biology and biochemistry student. I am interested in many aspects of my field, specifically diseases and attempting to find possible treatments for them. In my lab, I use immunohistochemistry to compare transplant arteriosclerosis between two different types of mice, one wildtype and one lacking an IL-17A receptor.

### More Information

I enjoy knitting and martial arts.
